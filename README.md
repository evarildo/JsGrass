# JsGrass
Dynamic Grass made in Js 

You can check it out in the page: http://lucasm0ta.github.io/JsGrass/

This program draws moving grass using the canvas feature of HTML5. Each leaf was created by brute force until it got a good shape with two besier curves and a line between them. The leafs rotate relative to its base with different time for each one.
