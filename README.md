# JsGrass
Dynamic Grass made in Js 

You can check it out in the page: http://lucasm0ta.github.io/JsGrass/

## Details
It draws moving grass' leafs using the canvas feature of HTML5. Each leaf was created two bezier curves and a line between them (beacuse the canvas drawing left some space between the two bezier). Has the possibilty to change some parameters that are hardcoded:


FPS: Number of loops per second of leafs state.
SPEED: How much the leafs change in each rotation.
LAMBDA: The wavelength.
